The G3F is a **Global, Multidimensional Spectral Regression Analysis** package for IgorPro. It allows to apply flexible combinations of global parameters and dimensionally local (spectral) parameters to 2- and 3-dimensional data matices.

**LOADING AND OPENING G3F IN IGOR PRO:**

The G3F package consists of several files:

- G3F\_Main.ipf
- G3F\_Auxillary.ipf
- G3F\_Desktop.ipf
- G3F\_DoTheFit.ipf
- G3F\_Feedback.ipf
- G3F\_FitFlow.ipf
- G3F\_Guesses.ipf
- G3F\_List&amp;Set.ipf
- G3F\_Setup.ipf
- G3F\_Struct.ipf

Download all files from [G3F folder](https://github.com/dap-biospec/G3F/blob/master/G3F/) and save in one local folder.

From the top menu IgorPro:<br/>
File -> Open File -> Procedureâ€¦

Navigate to and select the G3F\_Main.ipf file to load. Complile G3F\_Main.ipf - this will load all dependnet procedure file slisted above.

**Opening main G3F control panel:**

From the top menu IgorPro:<br/>
Analysis -> Global 3D Spectral Regression -> Control Panel

[G3F Manual](https://github.com/dap-biospec/G3F/blob/master/G3F_Manual.md)

A [Demo Experiment](https://github.com/dap-biospec/G3F/blob/master/Demo) is included with this package. The tutorial is in the [Demo Experiment](https://github.com/dap-biospec/G3F/blob/master/G3F_Manual.md#demo-experiment) section of the manual.
